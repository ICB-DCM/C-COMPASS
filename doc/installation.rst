Trouble-Shooting
----------------

- **SmartScreen Warning**: If Windows blocks the application via SmartScreen, it is because the software is unsigned. Please consult your IT department to bypass this restriction if necessary.
- **Long Path Issues on Windows**: If your system encounters long path errors, you can enable long paths in your registry:
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem`.
   - Set the value of **LongPathsEnabled** to `1`.
